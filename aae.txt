Powdery Mildew on Basil Plants
Cause:

	It initially appears as tiny greyish specks on the underside of leaves and progresses to cover larger areas of the lower leaf surface. 
	The fungus may appear raised from the leaf surface or 'fluffy' in appearance.
Treatment:
	Baking soda is one of the best home remedies for treating powdery mildew. 
	For this method, 1ix 1 tablespoon baking soda and ½ teaspoon liquid soap in 1 gallon of water. 
	Transfer it into a spray bottle and spray the tops and underside of leaves and any other affected areas.
