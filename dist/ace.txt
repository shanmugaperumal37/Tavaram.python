Root Rot Disease in Basil Plant
Causes:
	Overwatering basil or using a potting mix with insufficient drainage causes root rot. 
	Fusarium wilt is a soil-borne fungus that once in the stem, stops water traveling through the plant. 
	Early signs are leaf discoloration, wilting, leaves curling, drooping, leaf drop, and the stem twisting.
Treatment:
	To revive dying basil place it in the shade and buffer it from excess wind, ensures the soil is consistently moist but not saturated and prune back any brown leaves.
