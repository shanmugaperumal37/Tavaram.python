Aphids in Rose Plant
Causes:
	Aphids usually overwinter on roses as eggs laid on the stems in the previous autumn. 
	However, in sheltered places there may be active nymphs and adults all year round. 
	Aphid numbers start to increase in spring when roses are producing new growth and reach a peak in early summer.
Treatment:
	Mix 1 part vinegar with three parts water in a spray bottle. 
	Add a 2-5ml few drops of dish soap to the mixture to help it stick to the leaves of the plants. 
	Shake the mixture well to combine.
	 Spray the mixture directly on the aphids and on the leaves of the plants where they are present.
